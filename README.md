# Purism Core

OpenL2D Purism Core is a FOSS reimplementation of Live2D's Cubism Core in D.
We offer a better, more ergonomic API alongside compatibility with the legacy
Cubism Core API.

**We make extensive use of the `@safe` attribute to guarantee memory safety.
While Purism Core may occasionally crash, no crash should be the result of an
exploitable bug.**
